"Now the main technical roadblocks before ULA clears the Vulcan rocket for launch are the Flight Readiness Firing and an investigation into an explosive blast during a ground structural test of a Centaur 5 upper stage test article in March. ULA says the “anomaly” was caused by a hydrogen leak, causing the flammable fuel to accumulate inside the test rig before it ignited.

The blast damaged the test stand and caved in the forward dome of the Centaur test article, according to Bruno. The leak originated in a “steel pressure vessel” on the Centaur test article, Bruno said Tuesday."

"We had one anomaly in our last qualification test on our upper stage,” Bruno said. “We had a leak in our steel pressure vessel, and we’ve just now got our hands in all the pieces of that. We’ll sort it out. We’ll resolve it. It’ll either take no corrective action, in which case we’ll fly very soon, or maybe we’ll have to do something to the flight vehicle, and it will be later in the year. We should know that very soon.”

"Centaur's thin-walled pressure stabilized tanks require minor reinforcement at the top of the forward dome prior to flight," ULA representatives wrote in the June 24 update.

In a brief statement early June 24, ULA said it would remove the Centaur upper stage that had been installed on the Vulcan booster at Cape Canaveral for that inaugural launch and ship it back to the company’s Decatur, Alabama, factory
