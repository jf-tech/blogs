SpaceX have said the inspections/processing to let a recovered booster be reused now take less than 30 days, and is done entirely by operations in Florida, ie. no shipment back to manufacturing or to be tested at McGregor.

Edit (Aug 2020) : It sounds like the turbopump turbines need checking : Teslarati report :

“A bit more on turnaround work ... Musk said the company almost never needs to replace a whole engine, but that some parts like turbine wheels are changed at times. In terms of limits for the Falcon 9, Musk added that 100-plus flights are possible, although some parts will need to be replaced or upgraded. Cleaning all nine Merlin turbines is difficult, he said.”

In August 2020, Elon Musk tweeted that refurbishment and reuse of a booster is done for less than 10% the price of a new booster while the payload reduction is below 40%. According to his tweet, SpaceX breaks even with a second flight per booster and saves money from the third flight on.[81] At that time, Falcon 9 Block 5 had made 35 flights with 11 boosters.

most of the work is decoking the engines, decoking the welds they inspect, inspecting welds, replacing ablative shielding as required, and most likely testing all electronics.

Musk in the past said that recovery was "a few million"
F9 upper stage costs about $10 million, and the marginal cost per flight not counting overheads is about $15-20 million

return to port usually takes 2-3 days

fastest booster turnaround is 21 days (including 4.5 days back to port) - 16 days refurbish process.

SpaceX says that the actual process of refurbishing Falcon 9 B1062 took just 9 days
