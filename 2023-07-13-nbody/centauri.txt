orbital velocity
A: -21km/s
B: -18km/s
relative speed 3km/s
----------------------------
Alpha Centauri A and B, which form a binary star system, orbit each other with an average distance (semi-major axis) of about 23 astronomical units (AU) - approximately the distance between the Sun and Uranus. The eccentricity of their orbit is about 0.52, which indicates a relatively elliptical orbit.

Their orbital period is about 79.91 years. The orbital speed of a body in a binary system varies depending on its position in the orbit (it's not a constant value because the orbit is elliptical, not circular), but we can calculate an average orbital speed using the following formula:

r
Copy code
v = 2 * pi * a / T
where:

v is the orbital speed,
a is the semi-major axis,
T is the orbital period,
pi is the mathematical constant ~3.14159.
However, to use this formula, we need to make sure that the semi-major axis a is in the same unit as the orbital period T. As we have a in AU and T in years, we need to convert AU to the same unit/year.

Knowing that 1 AU is approximately equal to 1.496e+11 meters and 1 year is about 3.154e+7 seconds, we can convert the semi-major axis to meters and the orbital period to seconds, and then use the formula to find the average orbital speed in m/s:

makefile
Copy code
a_m = 23 AU * 1.496e+11 m/AU = 3.44e+12 m
T_s = 79.91 years * 3.154e+7 s/year = 2.52e+9 s

v = 2 * pi * a_m / T_s = 8605 m/s
This would be the average orbital speed of the stars around their center of mass. Since the two stars have similar masses, they will have similar orbital speeds.
